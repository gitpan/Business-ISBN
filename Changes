1.84 - Tue Jan  9 23:10:00 2007
	* updated copyright and license info
	* no code changes, so no need to upgrade

1.82 - Sun Aug 14 11:42:18 2005
	* fixed up publisher code validation, since 0 can be a valid
	code. I hadn't run into one of those before, and now I know
	I wasn't doing that right.
	* This is an important code change. Everyone should upgrade.

1.81 - Sat Aug 13 22:08:40 2005
	* exposed the country group name as the country() method

1.80 - Tue Mar  8 16:58:47 2005
	* added POD coverage tests and documented the uncovered methods
	it found

1.79 - Tue Dec 14 05:00:37 2004
* Updated tests for new ISBN data: previously invalid ISBNs are now
valid.  The latest data is in Business::ISBN::Data 1.09 and is current
as of November 2004.
* You don't need this version of Business::ISBN if you already have it,
although you should get the latest Business::ISBN::Data.

1.78 - Sun Nov 21 19:46:40 2004
* Require the latest version on Business::ISBN::Data, which was unbundled in 
the last version.  You need Business::ISBN::Data 1.08 to pass the latest 
tests that check for the new ranges the ISBN folks assigned a couple of
years ago.

1.77 - Wed Oct 27 02:39:17 2004
* removed Business::ISBN::Data, which is now a separate module so you
can update the data without updating the rest of the stuff.  Previously,
CPAN.pm would install Business::ISBN::Data as a prerequisite, and this 
distribution would come along and overwrite it with old data.  That
was a bad thing.

1.76 - Fri Oct  8 16:12:51 2004
* somehow this module went missing from CPAN, so here it is again
* no need to upgrade if you have the previous version

1.74 - Thu Sep  2 17:17:20 2004
* another distro fix: some documentation cleanups, and the README is
now in MANIFEST.  You do not need to upgrade if you already have
installed this module.

1.73 - Thu Sep  2 16:21:10 2004
* this is a distro fix only.  if you already have Business::ISBN, you
don't need this

1.72 - Wed Feb 11 16:18:30 2004
	* removed errant File::Find::Rule use
	* Check for modules in png_barcode before require-ing them

1.71 - Wed Jan 28 13:00:38 2004
	* added xISBN support
	* removed File::Find::Rule, Test::Pod, Test::Prereq dependencies

1.69	Thu Sep  5 01:18:26 CDT 2002
	- documentation fixes - that's it
	
1.68	Wed Sep  4 15:51:29 CDT 2002
	- converted to Test::More
	- fixed ean_to_isbn to handle new EAN prefix 979

1.60	Sun Apr  1 17:06:28 EDT 2001
	- fixed some POD problems
	- no changes to the actual code

1.59	Tue Mar 27 11:51:42 EST 2001
	- fixed some -w dirty internals
	- clarified documentation for as_string method

1.58	Mon Mar 26 19:47:03 EST 2001
	- there was an error in test.pl that failed to
	identify a bug. Andy Lester <andy@petdance.com>
	found it though.  the constructor was always
	setting $obj->is_valid to BAD_CHECKSUM.  that
	is fixed.
	- version 1.57 should not be used at all.  it
	is severely broken due to that bug.

1.57	Wed Mar 21 18:07:17 EST 2001
	- fixed -w dirty line in is_valid_checksum
	(identified by Andy Lester <andy@petdance.com>)

1.56	  Mon Mar 12 10:03:37 EST 2001
	EVERYONE SHOULD UPGRADE TO THIS VERSION
	- fixed problem parsing ISBNs without valid
	country codes which would cause an infinite
	loop. (identified by Andy Lester <andy@petdance.com>)
	- this module is now kept in a local CVS repository
	- added symbolic constants to replace magic return
	values.  see the docs for details.
	- fixed is_valid_checksum which would issue warnings
	if the string was less than ten characters
	(identified by Adam Thompson <athompso@athompso.net>)
	- added a test.pl which still needs more tests to
	reach all of the code.

1.51      Wed Jan 24 14:22:02 EST 2001
	- version 1.5 fixed some bugs with checksums
	- version 1.51 has a few minor doc fixes
	- now we have sane version numbers. :)

20001010  Sat Sep  9 00:33:07 EDT 2000
	- fixed some missing arguments to _is_valid.  
	- updated contact information
	- added some real tests to test.pl
	- everyone should update their installations

19990112  Mon Jan 11 18:03:07 EST 1999
	- added "use Exporter" which was missing.  

19980901  Tue Sep 01 15:15:30 1998
	- added support for EAN-13 (isbn -> ean, ean -> isbn )
	- cleaned up other nagging problems
	- if you don't want EAN13, then you don't need this update

19980329  Sun Mar 29 03:29:16 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
	- gutsy enough to actually release it for testing and comments
