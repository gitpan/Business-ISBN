1.69	Thu Sep  5 01:18:26 CDT 2002
	- documentation fixes - that's it
	
1.68	Wed Sep  4 15:51:29 CDT 2002
	- converted to Test::More
	- fixed ean_to_isbn to handle new EAN prefix 979

1.60	Sun Apr  1 17:06:28 EDT 2001
	- fixed some POD problems
	- no changes to the actual code

1.59	Tue Mar 27 11:51:42 EST 2001
	- fixed some -w dirty internals
	- clarified documentation for as_string method

1.58	Mon Mar 26 19:47:03 EST 2001
	- there was an error in test.pl that failed to
	identify a bug. Andy Lester <andy@petdance.com>
	found it though.  the constructor was always
	setting $obj->is_valid to BAD_CHECKSUM.  that
	is fixed.
	- version 1.57 should not be used at all.  it
	is severely broken due to that bug.

1.57	Wed Mar 21 18:07:17 EST 2001
	- fixed -w dirty line in is_valid_checksum
	(identified by Andy Lester <andy@petdance.com>)

1.56	  Mon Mar 12 10:03:37 EST 2001
	EVERYONE SHOULD UPGRADE TO THIS VERSION
	- fixed problem parsing ISBNs without valid
	country codes which would cause an infinite
	loop. (identified by Andy Lester <andy@petdance.com>)
	- this module is now kept in a local CVS repository
	- added symbolic constants to replace magic return
	values.  see the docs for details.
	- fixed is_valid_checksum which would issue warnings
	if the string was less than ten characters
	(identified by Adam Thompson <athompso@athompso.net>)
	- added a test.pl which still needs more tests to
	reach all of the code.

1.51      Wed Jan 24 14:22:02 EST 2001
	- version 1.5 fixed some bugs with checksums
	- version 1.51 has a few minor doc fixes
	- now we have sane version numbers. :)

20001010  Sat Sep  9 00:33:07 EDT 2000
	- fixed some missing arguments to _is_valid.  
	- updated contact information
	- added some real tests to test.pl
	- everyone should update their installations

19990112  Mon Jan 11 18:03:07 EST 1999
	- added "use Exporter" which was missing.  

19980901  Tue Sep 01 15:15:30 1998
	- added support for EAN-13 (isbn -> ean, ean -> isbn )
	- cleaned up other nagging problems
	- if you don't want EAN13, then you don't need this update

19980329  Sun Mar 29 03:29:16 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
	- gutsy enough to actually release it for testing and comments
